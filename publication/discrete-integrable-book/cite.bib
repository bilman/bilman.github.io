abstract="This chapter is devoted to the integrability of discrete systems and their relation to the theory of Yang--Baxter (YB) maps. Lax pairs play a significant role in the integrability of discrete systems. We introduce the notion of Lax pair by considering the well-celebrated doubly-infinite Toda lattice. In particular, we present solution of the Cauchy initial value problem via the method of the inverse scattering transform, provide a review of scattering theory of Jacobi matrices, and give the Riemann--Hilbert formulation of the inverse scattering transform. On the other hand, the Lax--Darboux scheme constitutes an important tool in the theory of integrable systems, as it relates several concepts of integrability. We explain the role of Darboux and B{\"a}cklund transformations in the theory of integrable systems, and we show how they can be used to construct discrete integrable systems via the Lax--Darboux scheme. Moreover, we give an introduction to the theory of Yang--Baxter maps and we show its relation to discrete integrable systems. Finally, we demonstrate the construction of Yang--Baxter maps via Darboux transformations, using the Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger (NLS) equation as illustrative example.",
